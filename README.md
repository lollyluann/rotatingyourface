# Face Frontalization Using Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks
Luann Jung, Dylan Zhou

Implementation of 2-task and 3-task neural networks for face frontalization in Tensorflow.

The .py files can be run to begin training. For experimentation with hyperparameters, we suggest referencing the .ipynb versions.
